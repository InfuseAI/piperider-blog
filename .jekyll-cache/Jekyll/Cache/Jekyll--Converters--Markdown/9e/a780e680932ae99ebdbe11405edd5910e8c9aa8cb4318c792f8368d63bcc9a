I"<p>Datasets are readily available as CSV files on websites such as Kaggle and other real-world datasets. However, CSV isn‚Äôt really suitable for querying and transforming easily. Therefore, it‚Äôs better to store the data in a database.</p>

<p>In this article, you will use csvs-to-sqlite to convert CSV files into SQLite databases. Once the data is in a database, it‚Äôs easier for users to query with SQL and add to their ETL service.</p>

<p>We have to get the dataset first, here is an example of the <a href="https://github.com/ldkrsi/cpbl-opendata">CPBL dataset</a>.</p>

<p>‚Äú<a href="https://github.com/simonw/csvs-to-sqlite">csvs-to-sqlite</a>‚Äù tool is an open-source project and put it in the Github. We can easily use the pip install method to install the tools.</p>

<p>You can use the following commands to download the data and install the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/csvs-to-sqlite/">python package</a>.</p>

<p>After configuring the environment, we can convert the CSV files into several SQLite databases.</p>

<p>The format of the csvs-to-sqlite command is:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>csvs-to-sqlite /path/to/your.csv sqlite-db-name.db
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The result after we convert the CSV files into a database:

<h2 id="verify-the-csv-was-imported-correctly">Verify the CSV was imported correctly</h2>
<p>We can now check if the data was successfully inserted into the SQLite database using the ‚Äúsqlite3‚Äù command line tool to open the database and query the data.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/LiuYuWei/29cd132ca02351bb3f66a1680c521d39.js"></script>

<p>We have successfully queried the SQLite data, which is the same as the CSV data. Now, If a data engineer wanted to query the historical data of an individual baseball player, they could use SQL to query the data faster.</p>

<p>The result of querying data from the SQLite database:
