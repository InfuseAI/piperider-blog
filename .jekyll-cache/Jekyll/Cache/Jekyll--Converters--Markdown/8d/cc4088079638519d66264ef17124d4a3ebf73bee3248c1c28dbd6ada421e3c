I"'<p>The number of data sources that data teams have to deal with is ever increasing. According to a <a href="https://www.matillion.com/resources/blog/matillion-and-idg-survey-data-growth-is-real-and-3-other-key-findings">recent survey</a> by Matillion and IDG, the number of data sources per organization is around 400, with over 20 percent of organizations having 1000 or more. The sheer amount of data makes managing and tracking it increasingly difficult, never mind understanding the bigger picture. Thatâ€™s where data observability comes in.</p>
