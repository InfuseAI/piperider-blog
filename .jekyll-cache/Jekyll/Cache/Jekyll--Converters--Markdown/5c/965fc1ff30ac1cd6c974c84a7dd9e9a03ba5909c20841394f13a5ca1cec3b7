<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>Â If you missed out on PipeRiderâ€™s initial release, then now is a great time to take it for a spin.Â <strong>Data reliability just got even more reliableÂ with better dbt integration</strong>, data assertion recommendations, and reporting enhancements. PipeRider isÂ <a href="https://github.com/InfuseAI/piperider">open-source</a>Â and easy toÂ <a href="https://docs.piperider.io/quick-start?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=20220706&amp;utm_id=medium">get started</a>.</p>

<h2 id="piperider-recap">PipeRider Recap</h2>

<p>PipeRider is your open-source data reliability toolkit that connects to your existing data pipelines and provides data profiling, data quality assertions, convenient HTML reports, and integration with popular data warehouses.Â <a href="https://blog.infuseai.io/data-reliability-automated-with-piperider-7a823521ef11">Read more</a>Â about the story behind PipeRiderâ€™s creation.</p>

<h2 id="whats-new">Whatâ€™s New?</h2>

<p>Recent updates to PipeRider include the following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://blog.infuseai.io/test-your-data-quality-in-minutes-with-piperider-91da57a5c5d5#31b3">Recommended data assertion generation</a>Â â€” PipeRiderâ€™s intelligently generated assertions give you a head-start on data reliability.</li>
  <li><a href="https://blog.infuseai.io/test-your-data-quality-in-minutes-with-piperider-91da57a5c5d5#7d35">Improved dbt integration</a>Â â€” PipeRider will auto-detect your dbt project and data source settings. You can also run dbt tests with PipeRider and dbt test results are included in your report.</li>
  <li><a href="https://blog.infuseai.io/test-your-data-quality-in-minutes-with-piperider-91da57a5c5d5#7511">Improved reporting</a>Â â€” Automatically generated reports provide data profiling information and assertion results.</li>
</ul>

<p>Letâ€™s take a deeper dive into these new features.</p>

<h2 id="recommended-assertions">Recommended assertions</h2>

<p>The first time you run PipeRider and your data is profiled, PipeRider will offer to generate recommended assertions based on the profile of your data source.</p>

<p>PipeRider analyzes the contents of your data source and makes intelligent suggestions based on the content, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Asserting which columns require data and should not be null</li>
  <li>Asserting the schema type for columns</li>
  <li>Asserting the acceptable range of minimum and maximum values for numerical columns</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/img/posts/220706-3.png" alt="PipeRider's CLI tool offers to generate recommended data assertions based on your data profile" title="Generate recommended assertions with PipeRider on first run" /></p>

<p>By using the recommended assertions you give yourself a head start by not having to manually write all of the assertions. Instead, you can tweak and add to the recommendations if necessary.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/220706-4.png" alt="An example of a recommended assertions file generate by PipeRider, a data reliability tool" title="Example of PipeRider's recommended assertions for a data source" /></p>

<p>If youâ€™d rather not use the recommendations, PipeRider can also generate empty assertion template files, complete with column names, ready for you to customize withÂ <a href="https://docs.piperider.io/data-quality-assertions/assertion-configuration">built-in assertions</a>, or your ownÂ <a href="https://docs.piperider.io/data-quality-assertions/custom-assertions">custom assertions</a>.</p>

<h2 id="dbt-integration">dbt integration</h2>

<p>You can now initialize PipeRider inside your dbt project, this brings PipeRiderâ€™s profiling, assertions, and reporting features to your dbt models.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/220706-5.png" alt="PipeRider auto-detects your dbt project settings which makes adding data profiling to a dbt project easy" title="PipeRider auto detects your dbt project settings" /></p>

<p>PipeRider will automatically detect your dbt project settings and treat your dbt models as if they were part of your PipeRider project. This includes -</p>

<ul>
  <li>Profiling dbt models.</li>
  <li>Generating recommended assertions for dbt models.</li>
  <li>Testing dbt model data-profiles with PipeRider assertions.</li>
  <li>Including dbt test results in PipeRider reports.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/img/posts/220706-6.png" alt="PipeRider can run both dbt tests and PipeRider's own assertions with one command" title="PipeRider and dbt tests can be run with one command" /></p>

<p>You can also build your dbt models using PipeRider, which means itâ€™s possible to condense your dbt and PipeRider workflow to one command:Â <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">piperider run --dbt-build --dbt-test</code>. This one command will:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Build your dbt models.</li>
  <li>Profile your data with PipeRiderâ€™s profiler.</li>
  <li>Run your dbt tests.</li>
  <li>Test your data profile with PipeRider assertions</li>
  <li>Generate an HTML report.</li>
</ol>

<p>Full details and other available options can be found in theÂ <a href="https://docs.piperider.io/piperider-cli">command reference</a>.</p>

<h2 id="improved-reporting">Improved reporting</h2>

<p>Reports are now automatically generated each time you run PipeRider and include the following information.</p>

<ul>
  <li>All tables included</li>
  <li>Per-table profiling data</li>
  <li>Per-table test results</li>
  <li>Per-table dbt test results</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="report-overview">Report overview</h3>

<p>The report overview page shows a quick view of which tables or dbt models have been profiled and tested, along with stats about passed and failed tests.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/220706-7.png" alt="PipeRider report overview showing both PipeRider assertion results and dbt test results" title="PipeRider report overview showing both PipeRider assertion results and dbt test results" /></p>

<h3 id="per-table-reports">Per-table reports</h3>

<p>Click through to each table to view the data profile detailed test results for that table.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/220706-6.png" alt="View detailed per-table information on data profile and test results in PipeRider's report" title="PipeRider data table report features data profile and test results" /></p>

<h3 id="dbt-test-results">dbt test results</h3>

<p>If the PipeRider is run on a dbt project, then the report will include a tab with details of dbt-specific test results.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/220706-8.png" alt="View dbt test results in your PipeRider report" title="View dbt test results in your PipeRider report" /></p>

<h3 id="compare-reports">Compare reports</h3>

<p>Two reports can also be compared showing the differences between the data profile for each run, together with the expected and actual results for each test.</p>

<h3 id="no-excuse-for-unreliable-data">No excuse for unreliable data</h3>

<p>PipeRider is so easy to use there really is no excuse for not picking up on that data drift. All you need to do it:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://docs.piperider.io/install-piperider">Install PipeRider</a>Â (a quick install with pip)</li>
  <li>Point it to your data warehouse â€” if youâ€™re using dbt your settings will be auto-detected</li>
  <li>With oneÂ <a href="https://docs.piperider.io/piperider-cli">command</a>Â you can generate a data profile, with suggested assertions, and output a report</li>
</ol>

<p>Check out theÂ <a href="https://docs.piperider.io/quick-start?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=20220706&amp;utm_id=medium">quick-start guide</a>, which includes a sample dataset, for how to use the main features of PipeRider.</p>
